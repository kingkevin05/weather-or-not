# Weather-or-Not

Our application enables users to find fun events and activities in a given city. However, depending on the current weather conditions of a given city, our app will either suggest indoor events or outdoor hiking-related activities.

## Features

* Gives the user a list of indoor or outdoor activities based on current weather conditions.
* After the user inputs a city name and clicks search, a modal will appear that informs the user weather or not they should engage in indoor or ooutdoor activities.
* The user can toggle a music player that will enhance their experience
